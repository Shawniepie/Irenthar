 CITY_OF_HATE_NAME:0 "City of Hate"
 CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "The world teeters on a knife's edge. Arthenon, having secured his dominance over the Plains, now casts his gaze on the metal-rich mountains of Rimatü, though many still oppose him. The recently-liberated - by Elven standards - nation of Tlarthingia eyes a resurgent and militaristic Irinthios with unease. The beer halls of the Bergialer Kingdom echo ever louder with the battle-cries of those who seek to reclaim their ancestral lands. The fanatics of Ordoria proclaim their supremacy even as the men of the Ungerdaler Union enroach on their territory and Radical Republicans stand in open revolt in the Eastern domains, aided by the Dwarves. The world is poised for a conflict the likes of which have never before seen. The Fates are holding their breaths."
 GMR_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "It has been seventy-three years since Arthenon and his army sailed to the Northern Plains, bringing with him the mysterious magics of Noctheurgy and Lumotheurgy. It has been fourty-eight years since he crushed the last free nation of man on the Northern Plains, the kingdom of Trifell. Now, confident in his rule, Arthenon seeks to expand his power base - the metal-rich mountains of Rimatü are a worthy prize, and one has set his eyes on. However, rebellious forces yet fight against him, rallying around Ulmién Astrellion, pretender to the throne of Trifell. Will Arthenon triumph over his enemies, or will his hold over the Northern Plains be shattered?"
 ORD_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "Originally encompassing all of the lands between Arthenon's Domain and the Ungerdaler Union, the Empire of Ordoria has fallen on hard times recently. Under constant pressure from the Humans to the South, and betrayed by their own kin, throwing their lot in with the Dwarves of Skaelinger, the Ordorians have grown more and more fanatical in their devotion to the extermination of the lesser races of the world. Their treasonous kin to the East shall burn with the rest of the filth."
 UNG_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "Ever a web of intrigue, the Union of Ungerdaler Princes has grown ever more unstable in recent years. Holzbrenn is led by a madman, while the Freiprinz of Stahlhof is amassing ever more troops, ostensibly to hold back Ordorian forces. However, new hope burns for the Union in the form of Hochprinzessin Adelina, a competent and fiery young woman. She has plans to centralize the Union, put an end to the squabbling and restore her nation to greatness, but the forcess arrayed against her are mighty indeed. Will the Union shatter, or will it finally claim its rightful place as uncontested hegemon of South Latherin?"
 RTH_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "Born in the fires of revolution, the young nation of Rthauiaur is comprised of those Elves that found the Puritan doctrine of the Ordorian regime revolting. With the aid of the dwarves of Skaelinger, they succesfully waged a guerilla war against Ordoria and have remained close allies ever since. At the helm of the nation stands Alucien Derathur, scholar and advocate of radical Republicanism. Under his reign, Rthauiaur has flourised, but dark clouds gather on the Western horizon as the zealots of Ordoria seek to put down this revolution..."
 SKA_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "The last remnant of what was once the proud Kingdom of Ghinthor, the Free Stronghold of Skaelinger is locked in eternal struggle with the Kurgur Orcs, their mortal foes. Led by an assembly of clans under the guidance of Ystvigg Hellifast, bastard son of Ghintor's last King. The Dwarves of Skaelinger hold the reclamation of their ancestral homes in high regard, much like their exiled cousins in the Bergialer Kingdom, but their position is a tenuous one. To this end, and to prevent the presence of fanatics seeking their extermination to their West, Skaelinger has supported the Rthauiauran uprising. Time will tell if this was a wise move, or one that sealed the Dwarves' doom..."
 HLZ_CITY_OF_HATE_DESC:0 "A Freiprinztum suffering under the yoke of a tyrant, Holzbrenn is a country of famine and misery. The Mad Prince, Kaspar Rosenblut, has seen to it that his subjects suffer, though the focus of his ire are the non-humans in his principality, especially the Elves. However, not all is lost - even the aristocracy that rely on him for their legitimacy are whispering of dissent, and in the streets, the Libertines preach the gospel of freedom, while the Solidarity League rouses the masses with passionate words condemning the injustice and evil of the current government. The winds of change are blowing in Holzbrenn - but which way shall they go?"
